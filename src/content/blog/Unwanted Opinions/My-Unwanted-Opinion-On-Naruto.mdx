title: My Unwanted Opinion On Naruto
---

I must admit that as a kid, I never watched Naruto. I was always more of a Digimon guy, honestly. As I grew older, I heard a lot about the series, but I always thought that it was just another 500+ episode Shonen show. I don't watch One Piece because it's too long and never going to end, so why should I watch Naruto?

I distinctly remember hearing in 2017 that the last episode of Naruto has aired. Honestly, I was shocked. Not following the Manga or the Anime, I thought this show would go on forever. Then, when I heard there was a sequel centering around Naruto's kid, everything made sense once again - Naruto didn't just end, it's continuing under a new name.

So, why did I watch Naruto at the age of 23?

First, because my wife really wanted to watch it. This is a good enough reason alone, but there was something else. As I get older, I realize that I have held some biases against certain media ever since I was a kid. I always thought I was smart because I liked 70s rock music and not 2010s "pop garbage", as I called them. I always thought I had a higher standard of quality because I liked Christopher Nolan's films and not every generic action movie that came out to theaters.

At some point, though, pop music started sounding fine to me. I started seeing value in generic action movies, finding the actors and set-pieces enjoyable. Sometimes I reflect upon this change and I honestly can't understand why people would be so closed-off from new experiences. If you don't like something, that's fine. But give some things a go, and you might find something you'd enjoy.

So, when my wife came to me and said she wanted to watch it, a childhood instinct caused me to laugh and wave off the idea as silly. But then we watched the first episode, and it hit me once again - the first episode of Naruto is no different than any episode of any other Anime I watched.

The first episode of Naruto is based on the original one-shot Manga, focusing on a simple, fully-complete storyline where the main protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, is tricked to steal a forbidden scroll and must face the consequences and eventually defeat the vilian who tricked him. During this episode we learn that Naruto is hated by the Ninja Village he grows up in, because he has a Fox Demon, who has nearly destroyed the village before, sealed within him.

Naruto grows up without a mother or a father. In fact, he doesn't know who they were at all. This causes him to lash out and perform pranks on the village, in order to get attention from the rest of the village. Most of the episode is from the perspective of Iruka, Naruto's teacher, who treats him harshly as a teacher but ultimately thinks that there is something good inside Naruto, which just needs to be guided in the right direction. This faith from his teacher gives Naruto motivation to choose the path of hard work and good intentions, which leads him to defeat the villian and give back the scroll which he has stolen.

This episode is not special, because it doesn't have to be. It needed to be good, which is definitely is. This strong opening led me to think about the rest of the series. If this episode is just the same as any other from any other show, with its high-points and low-points and interesting characters and flaws, why should the rest of the series be any different?

So we kept on watching. We watched through the first arc, which introduced the rest of the main characters, and by the end we got hooked completely.

Naruto's main foil is Sasuke, a Ninja genius who really does not care for Naruto at all. This causes Naruto to choose Sasuke as his rival and is the main force behind Naruto's need to improve himself and get better as a Ninja. Sasuke, however, is only focused on one thing: killing his brother, who murdered his entire clan.

Also on Naruto's team is Sakura, a girl who, I must say, really has no personality at this point of the story except that she is in love with Sasuke and finds Naruto annoying. Of course, Naruto is himself in love with Sakura, which leads to the inevitable love triangle between all three.

The other main character, besides the children, is their leader, Kakashi. Arguably the most popular character from the series, Kakashi is a very capable Ninja who's general demeanor and and actions in the first arc of the story leads the viewers to ask themselves if there is something underneath the surface. Kakashi guides the team to treat each other as comrades, both on the battlefield and in their normal lives.

Following the first arc, the series takes a deep dive into the main story-line with over 100 episodes of continuous, non-filler action. Some people consider this to be the highlight of Naruto, culminating in one of the greatest fights in Anime history to close out the first part of the story. It did not disappoint us.

The thing about any television series is that it has a certain number of episodes, and it has to use them well. If it's only 12 episodes, it has to tell a story that makes sense and doesn't skip over any details for fear of overshooting. For shows with thousands of episodes, the show has to steadily develop its characters and introduce new elements in order to progress the story and keep the viewer interested.

Naruto takes over 100 episodes to prove to us that these characters, along with several side characters that I have not mentioned here, are not one-dimensional at all. Kakashi's training working provides the viewers with actual character development for the main three protagonists. Naruto, of course, becomes stronger and more capable, and starts winning over several other young Ninjas who have always mocked him. Sakura starts finding her place and coming to terms with the fact that all she cares about is one single person.

The most important and interesting development in this point of the story is Sasuke, who struggles with his need for revenge and the newfound love for his comrades. Sasuke, like Naruto in the first episode, has two paths that he can choose between, and his journey is a rollercoaster of emotions, where he experiences growth and regressions. The first part of Naruto proved to me that it doesn't matter if a show is 100+ episodes, because if it truly cares about its characters and works to tell a compelling story with them, then it can fill all of them with incredible drama and action.

The second part of the manga has been adapted into the much longer anime "Naruto: Shippuden", which continues the story and development of these characters. Three years older, the cast finds themselves in a constantly escalating conflict between the forces of good and evil, which were set up in the first part.

Shippuden is 500 episodes long, more than twice the length of the original, but it brings with it elements that were left out of the original. The world is developed much more and it's history is explored in almost every arc, while the relationships between the many forces at play in the overall stories prove to be complicated and morally-grey. Even some characters who were thought to be virtuos and right in the original series now have shade being cast upon them.

This serves as a backdrop for the continued development of the main characters. Naruto and Sasuke's journey now represents not only their own feelings, but what the entire world could become if only history has played out a little differently. Sakura, now forced to face her own lack of personality, finds what is most important to her throughout the series.

In this part, though, it is probably Kakashi that has the most interesting story for me. If Naruto and Sasuke are possible futures for the world, Kakshi is the preset. His childhood, molded by constantly ongoing war, is revealed to be as complex as the viewers believed in the original series. His backstory unfolds throughout the series, both in manga-original arcs and filler arcs that complete the full picture of a man that has absolutely nothing, while asking the most important question: does he deserve nothing?

The second part of Naruto sacrifices something that enticed a lot of viewers in the first part, and that is focus. While the original series focused on the characters, their personalities and relationships and their choices along the way, Shippuden tries to tell a much larger story about the nature of war and whether a world that allows war can really be allowed to exist. This mostly plays out in the second half of Shippuden, when the conflict that has been built up for 400 episodes finally comes to a head.

This is not to say that Shippuden does not deal with characters. In fact, Naruto himself has much more character development in Shippuden than he does in the original series. By being exposed to the newly expanded world in Shippuden, Naruto's worldview is refined and he has to come to terms with the possibility that all that he cares about might position him in an impossible choice between his comrades and the world he wants to protect.

The overall-700-episode series of Naruto allows this depth in both concept and characters
