In this part of the lands, every road leads to The Cotton Palace.

The beautiful green fields of the East and the blood-red flowers growing from the ground now seemed lonely and helpless in the winter rain. Every animal living here was now hiding as the drops battered the ground in pure ethereal anger.

A lone horse raced across the green and brown, carrying upon it a figure hooded in muted scarlet. The hood was drenched, along with his exposed leggings and boots. No rain would be able to slow down this man, and no man could stop the bloodshed he planned.

Eduard may have been King of these lands, but he has not seen the eastern fields in many years.

It was the fastest ride of his life, though the distance was not too long. From the Cyan River, where he warned his royal escorts that following him will have severe punishment, the trip would normally be about thirty minutes or so. Eduard felt he did in it five.

But Eduard was not focusing on the trip or the destination. His head raced through its own roads from memory to memory. From the day he married Cassandra to the day his son was born. The many moments of intimate love he felt for his queen and his heir, seeing his boy learn to ride on horseback, master archery and swordplay.

He remembered the tears he shed, returning from war south-side. The face of the man who delivered the news was blurry, but his words nestled in his mind like parasites.

He went on those first few search expeditions. He took the fastest horse in the palace and ran ahead of his guards and escorts. Three days and three nights he would venture out against the advice of his councilors. Even the wisest councilor could not fathom the loss of a wife and a son.

There was no sign of them. No one had seen anything odd, not even a footprint in the brown mud. All he had were hopes. For two years, he hoped.

Two years he sat alone. Not one thing brought him any semblance of joy. No conquest, no tournament, no feast, nothing could make him forget that night. Nothing could make him forget their eyes.

His mind’s eye now saw the events of yesterday. He had never snatched a scroll from a messenger until yesterday. He couldn’t help but doubt the man’s reading ability. He nearly destroyed the entire throne room, throwing and breaking anything that wasn’t nailed to the ground.

Today, he rides furiously through the villages of the east. A scarlet blur who none would suspect would be King of the lands.

The Cotton Palace was small and ancient. The carvings on the white walls did not impress Eduard on this day.

He stopped his horse and jumped off, his boots landed with a splash in the puddles. The guards were already rushing forward to warn him of coming any closer. One tried saying something, yelling through the noise of rainfall. Eduard did not hear him.

“If you know your place in this world you will let me through,” Eduard yelled back, “for I am your King, and I have passage to anywhere in my Lands.”

He took off his hood and revealed his face. The guards stood back and stared aimlessly at each other, clearly wondering what the right course of action was. Finally, one spoke back. “We received clear orders, sir. None shall pass these gates, not even the King himself.”

“If you wish to fall for such a foolish purpose, have it your way.” Eduard unsheathed the great sword Aerev, made of northern metal and aligned with black diamonds on the hilt, passed down through generations of Eduard’s dynasty.

In a matter of moments, the guards’ blades were laying in the dirt below the palace walls. One of the guards was unlucky, attacking the king with a full intent to kill. His attack ended with Eduard’s blade cutting through his stomach. The other guard seemed to gain some wisdom from this and ran away. Eduard wasted no time pitying the guards.

The doors flew open, clanging against the stone walls. The hallway before him stretched on and split apart into countless rooms and halls. There was no point to them. Eduard only continued forward, holding his blooded blade firmly in his hands. Some housekeepers and servants would recoil at the sight of him.

Another door flew open, and another after that. The red carpet hid the blood dripping from the blade. The white walls would drive Eduard mad if he had any capacity to be madder. Another guard stood before the Lady’s hall. He unsheathed his blade as well.

Eduard continued forward and the guard raised his blade, which came down upon Aerev’s metal blade with a clang. Eduard twisted his blade around, but the guard seemed more skilled than those outside. The guard rescinded his first strike and tried once more but made the mistake of attacking Eduard’s left. The king’s blade protected him once more, this time twisting to drive the guard’s sword away from Eduard.

In a single moment Eduard pierced his blade through the guard’s armor, slashing his side. The guard dropped to the floor in agony, the crowd around them let out a terrorized gasp. Some cried. Eduard moved on.

She sat across the room from Eduard, as if she knew he would arrive precisely at this moment. She looked exactly as he remembered her – her brown hair was straight and reached far down her back and her hands were small and nimble. She wore a beautiful white gown laced with golden threads. Ten servants sat beside her. Five guards stood by the walls on each side.

Eduard channeled his feeling into a singular scream. “Cassandra!”

His voice echoed around the room. All the servants seemed frightened. Cassandra was not impressed.

Eduard continued in a direct line towards Cassandra. Three guards leaped forward and blocked his progress. Eduard gripped his blade once more.

“Eduard,” she said. Her voice was as delicate as he remembered. “If you wish to talk, you will lay down your blade and sit before me, as is custom in these lands.”

“These lands are mine, Cassandra. No matter what title you may take upon yourself.”

“These lands are no longer part of your kingdom. Like my father and mother, the only thing I take upon myself is responsibility.”

Eduard felt his grip tightening around the hilt of his sword. “Wise words from a woman who abandoned her family.”

“I abandoned nothing, Eduard.”

“Then where is the boy, Cassandra? Where is my son?”

“Our son,” she said, emphasizing her own part of the missing child, “is not a boy. He is a man.”

“A dead man, perhaps. How does a boy go out with his mother and completely disappear?”

“As I said, Eduard. If you wish to talk, you must put down your blade.”

Eduard struggled against his own mind. His heart told him to never let go of his fury, but his brain knew the smarter option is to listen. He put the sword back in its sheath and set it down on the ground. The guards slowly backed away from him, allowing him to see Cassandra clearly.

He looked into her eyes, trying to find even a shred of guilt or sorrow over this whole affair. He couldn’t read her. He couldn’t understand her.

“Well,” he said, “you have my attention.”

“Very well. Ask whichever questions you can think of.”

“Where is the boy, Cassandra?”

“I have not seen our son in many months. I only received a message from him a week ago.”

“So, he’s alive?”

Cassandra seemed to hesitate. “Yes, he is.”

“How did all of this happen? What did you do, Cassandra?”

“I did nothin-“

“Nothing? You call disappearing from the palace with our son nothing? Leaving me alone for two years is nothing?”

“Have you put down your sword because you wanted to talk? Or do you wish to listen?”

Her words pierced his ears, forcing him to obey. A feeling he had not felt in a while returned to him – weakness. He was always weak around Cassandra. He stayed silent.

“Very well. As I said, I have done nothing. I did not leave the palace of my own accord that day. I did not stay hidden because I wished to be hidden.

Two years ago, you went out to war against the southern uprising. My father, Lord of these eastern lands, did not give you the soldiers you asked for. Do you remember what you did to him?”

Eduard remembered. He remembered Cassandra’s father like he remembered every other life he had ever taken.

“You did not listen to me. You did not listen to your advisors. You made your own decision, just like always.

“I started listening back then. I listened to all the servants talking behind your back. I listened to the people in our city. I asked to hear the leaders of the Southern uprising, hiding letters from them explaining their reasoning. It all painted one bleak picture of a man who longed for power above all else.

“Deep down, I always knew you were a tyrant, Eduard. I knew your father and grandfather did not have to deal with so many wars in their time. But I thought if I was on your side, I would be safe.”

Eduard couldn’t listen anymore. “Everything I have ever done was for us, Cassandra. For our kingdom and our people.”

“But the people rejected you, and you were the only one who couldn’t see that. Why do you think my father refused your request?”

“So, you ran away and left me in the dark because you feared I might kill you as well?”

“I knew you wouldn’t kill me, Eduard.”

“Then tell me why!” He shouted and drew his blade once more. The guards leaped forward again. Cassandra got up from her throne.

“I wasn’t the only one who felt unsafe, Eduard. I wasn’t the one who decided to leave that night.”

The picture suddenly became crystal clear in his mind. Cassandra did not ride alone, nor was it her decision to ride that night. A young man with short blonde hair, only seventeen years of age, was the one responsible for all of this.

“Our boy…” He muttered. Cassandra nodded.

“He came to me that night. He told me we must leave now, because you were killed in combat and the southerners are coming to the palace at dawn. He instructed me through his escape plan, taking the horses, riding along the route he planned so that no one could see us until we arrived at The Cotton palace. We took shelter with my mother here, in the palace. Only a select few knew of our presence.

“Soon it became clear that you were not dead. Our son became more aggressive. He convinced me and my mother that we were in grave danger. That you wanted to hurt us.”

“Me?” Eduard said, unknowingly lowering his weapon, “why would I want to hurt you?”

“Because you’re a madman,” Cassandra replied. “Because you thought we were plotting against you.”

“I thought none of that.”

“It doesn’t matter now, Eduard. We feared you.”

Silence filled the room as Eduard processed it all. The thought of his son planning this whole thing because he was afraid of him could have brought him to tears. All of it confused him. It didn’t make sense in his head. He always cared for the boy. He taught him everything he knew.

Something still bothered him.

“Why are you telling me all of this, Cassandra? Wouldn’t it be easier to just tell your guards to kill me?”

“It would, yes. But I couldn’t do that to you.”

Now it was her who looked into his eyes. He hoped she could see how sorry he was and that all his anger was now replaced with desperation and sorrow. He hoped she could see he still loved her.

“So where is he now? Our son?” He asked.

“He left shortly after my mother died. He told me it was time to reveal ourselves. Time to take action.”

“What do you mean?”

Cassandra turned around and paced back to her throne. She picked up something that was laying to the side of the seat - a blade. Unsheathing it, Cassandra revealed the sharp edge of the long and curved sword. “Do you not understand, Eduard? It is time to take action against you.”

“Cassandra…” He gripped Aerev with all his strength. Cassandra stomped her feet on the ground and the guards filed away back to their position. Eduard realized all of this was planned.

“Our son was patient. He has prepared everything, waiting for the right moment. His instructions to me were clear, just like they were two years ago.”

“Cassandra, you don’t have to do this. Don’t you realize this was all a misunderstanding? I would never hurt either one of you.”

“And yet, you killed my father without remorse,” Cassandra replied. “Just for opposing you.”

Cassandra raised her blade and stepped closer to Eduard. He knew what was about to happen. All he could do was delay the inevitable.

“Before we do this, tell me. What is his plan, Cassandra? I have to know.”

She now held her blade before her body. “When my mother died and I took her place, he knew our time of hiding would end. He knew he could lure you here if only you heard of me, still alive. And now, you would die of my blade, and he can go and claim your palace and your throne.”

“My… He wants to usurp my kingdom?”

“He has probably already done so. All I had to do was make sure you wouldn’t come back, and then my people would be released from the tyranny of your royal dynasty.”

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t find anger. Every decision he has ever made filled his head with noise like prayer bells and drums of war. Every decision has brought him here. He knew he deserved this. The cries of citizens slaughtered and imprisoned for the crime of criticizing his rule. The sight of blood flowing down the muddy soil. The face of Cassandra’s father.

All he could do now was raise his blade and fight.

It was Cassandra who attempted the first strike, leaping forward towards Eduard, who defended with his own blade. Quickly, Eduard attempted a piercing blow, but Cassandra was light on her feet. He knew she was skilled with the blade, but she must have trained in these two years.

The way she moved her blade seemed to Eduard like brush strokes made by a delicate painter. He didn’t want to hurt her. She pushed him back towards the door of the hall.

His hands started getting heavy, and her movements sped up. Her blade managed to get past him, slashing at the side of chest. The cut stung and burned, but Eduard didn’t let it distract him. He raised his sword and lowered it with force upon Cassandra. She struggled to block, which allowed Eduard to try it once more.

This time, Cassandra lowered herself to the ground. Eduard lost his balance as she cut the back of his leg, causing him to fall to one knee. Almost instinctively he pushed his blade forward and cut down some of her gown, revealing a newly-injured arm, bleeding upon the white strings of her clothes.

Her hand now grabbed his wrist, twisting it until he dropped Aerev to the floor. He knew she could have just cut off his arm from that position. The hand quickly grabbed the back of his nape while the other positioned her blade against his chest. He stopped breathing, defeated. From the beginning, he had no chance of hurting Cassandra.

But she stopped as well. All she needed to do was push the blade towards his chest. Before, the sound of their feet and the clashing of the steel blades filled the room. Now, only heavy breathing accompanied the rain outside.

“I will not kill you, Eduard.”

He wanted to ask why, but he couldn’t open his mouth.

“All my life I did everything for others. For my father, for my mother. For our son… For you. In these last two years I realized what I want most.”

A single tear dropped to the ground before she drew back her sword. “This is what I told him as well. Leave me alone. Leave my people alone. Today I will not harm you, but I request that tomorrow you will not drag me back into this.”

She turned around and stepped back to her throne. Eduard was left speechless. Her footsteps echoed through the silent halls, as if the entire east held their breath.

Slowly, he got up. His leg hurt. He picked up his blade from the ground. Eduard wanted to say something to her, anything at all. But he knew it wasn’t right.

He turned around and walked out. He kept walking through the bloody halls he left inside. He kept walking until he reached the outside. The rain was still strong, but the night was much darker now.

The horse he left was still here. He jumped up on his back and trotted back to the guards he left behind. He couldn’t see it in the night, but he looked towards his royal palace.

He was surely there already. He must have convinced them all that he was dead. Eduard knew his time as king was over. His son reigns, taking the last thing Eduard held dear. How cruel and ruthless has his child grown?

Eduard thought about all that he had taught him. Back then, all he wanted was for his son to be as great a king as he was. The thought of this being a kind of success made him chuckle for the first time in two years.

Cassandra’s words echoed in his head. He wanted to tell her how sorry he was. He wanted to share with her all the pain he felt in every moment of his time as king. He wanted to cry with her over the actions of their child, over the horrible things they have gone through.

Perhaps he should have done those things years ago.
